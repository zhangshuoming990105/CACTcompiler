# Compiler

Compiler for toy language "CACT", as UCAS Compiler Principle's Experiment, the frontend uses antlr codegen. the backend target is RISCV64GC.

before run, need to make an antlr-runtime folder. See the antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.8-source.zip

Run `./build.sh` to compile; binary is called "main".

detailed operation: please see in report.

hope this will be a raw guidance for Compiler practice, be free to use as a reference, BUT DO NOT COPY STRAIGHTLY!
